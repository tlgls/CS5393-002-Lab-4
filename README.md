Lab over Heaps and Graphs

Heaps:

Objectives:
The primary objective of this program is to implement a Priority Queue using a heap data structure with message handling for errors and successes. A PriorityQ class was created using a vector to design the heap, with private functions like parent, leftChild, rightChild, heapifyUp, and heapifyDown to manage the heap. Public functions such as empty(), size(), top(), push(), pop(), and print () allow interaction with the queue. The program inserts elements, prints the queue contents, and removes elements while displaying the status and handling empty queue exceptions. 

Graphs:

Objectives: 
The objective of this program is to implement a graph with 6 nodes using two different representations: an adjacency list and an adjacency matrix. These two approaches will be compared for their efficiency and ease of use. Additionally, the program will include depth-first search (DFS) traversal methods: preorder, inorder, and postorder, implemented as member functions within a graph class. The DFS functions will explore the graph by visiting nodes in a specific order to demonstrate the traversal patterns for each method.
